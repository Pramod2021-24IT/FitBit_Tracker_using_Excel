## Introduction

In this project, our primary objective is to analyze the data collected from Fitbit fitness datasets. The insights derived from this analysis will play a crucial role in aiding WeFit and its affiliated subsidiaries in making well-informed marketing and business decisions. By delving into the trends associated with using smart devices for health and fitness, we intend to refine and optimize our marketing strategies. Furthermore, our focus extends to identifying potential customers who exhibit a propensity towards investing in personalized diet plans tailored for effective weight loss. Through a comprehensive understanding of these dynamics, we aspire to enhance customer experiences and overall business outcomes.

## Business Tasks

There are four tasks in this Excel project-
Task 1- To find potential customers for selling weight loss plans.
Task 2- To find potential customers for fitwear.
Task 3- To find potential customers to increase the subscriptions of sleepy nights.
Task 4- To make the Dashboard for unique id and unique date.

## Data Source

The data utilized for this case study originates from the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (https://zenodo.org/record/53894#.Y7PTU3ZBy3C). This dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was originally uploaded by Möbius. The dataset has been made accessible on Kaggle.com under the CC0: Public Domain Creative Common License, relinquishing all ownership rights and granting unrestricted usage for distribution, performance, and replication of the dataset. Möbius attributed Furberg, Robert, Brinton, Julia, Keating, and Ortiz, Alexa as the authors associated with the Zendo dataset (refer to Source).
The datasets were generated through responses collected via an Amazon Mechanical Turk survey conducted between 03.12.2016 and 05.12.2016. A cohort of thirty eligible Fitbit users provided their consent for the submission of personalized tracker data, encompassing minute-level records for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports within the dataset can be sorted based on the export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Discrepancies in the output reflect variations in the utilization of diverse Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors and preferences.

## Methodology

To accomplish the aforementioned objectives, the following sequential steps were undertaken:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   The initial phase involved thorough data preprocessing, wherein the Fitbit fitness tracker data underwent a comprehensive cleaning and formatting process, rendering it ready for subsequent analysis.

2. Smart Device Usage Trends Analysis:
   Subsequently, an in-depth exploration of the data was conducted to discern noteworthy patterns and trends pertinent to the utilization of smart devices for fitness-tracking purposes.
   
4. Customer Segmentation:
   Employing advanced analytical techniques, the user base was meticulously categorized into distinct groups based on varying activity levels and diverse fitness aspirations.
   
6. Potential Customer Identification:
   Leveraging a set of well-defined criteria encompassing factors such as Body Mass Index (BMI), weight loss objectives, and prevailing health conditions, a selection of potential customers inclined toward personalized diet plans emerged.

7. Marketing Plan Optimization:
   The insights gleaned from the analytical endeavor were harnessed to fine-tune and enhance the efficacy of existing marketing strategies. This adaptive approach facilitated precision targeting of the identified potential customers, thereby optimizing resource allocation and impact.

## Results

The outcomes of our analysis, encompassing the revelations concerning smart device usage trends, the identification of potential customers seeking personalized diet plans, and the refined marketing strategies, have been meticulously compiled within the MS Excel workbooks. These comprehensive workbooks can be readily accessed within the repository, providing a holistic overview of the insights derived from our investigation.
